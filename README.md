## Introduction

London Crime is a flask, web-based application created to display recent crime statistics in London, aiming to help 
police officers conduct analysis and help citizens protect themselves. To provide a straightforward visual display of crime data, 
the web app showcases total crime cases in London from 2020 to 2021 in a dashboard sorted by crime types and borough levels. 
The data is provided by Metropolitan Police Service.

Users can access the crime dashboard by registering an account on the web app (with an email address). 
There are two additional core features which are user profile and email integration:

- Users can create or modify their user profile (i.e. profile photo, region, personal description)
